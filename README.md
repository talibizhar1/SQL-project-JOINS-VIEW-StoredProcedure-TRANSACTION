## Introduction

On Medium([link](https://medium.com/@bltizr9/final-project-advanced-sql-techniques-29953f6d1099)) I have provided the screenshots of resluts.
In this project I will be answering question with advanced SQL techniques like joins, view, stored procedure and transaction statements.
* First task mentioned here
## Task A: Create a database
I downloaded the datasets available in ‘.sql ‘ format and imported all the tables one by one in MySQL database ‘practicedb’ by 
running the SQL script. We can see tables available in the database by querying ‘show tables’.*/
*  Meta Data
* I wrote a query ‘desc <table name>’ to find the data type and dimension of each table.
1. Chicago Public School- Table has 566 rows & 78 columns.
2. Chicago Crime data-  This table has 21 columns and 533 row
3. Socioeconomic table named Census Data- 6 Census data has only 9 columns and 77 rows
